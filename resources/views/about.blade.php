                  MedCentral was opened in 1990 as a GP practice on the site of the old Mercerâ€™s Hospital.  We are committed in our efforts to provide healthcare for the sick and needy of Dublin, honouring the legacy of the founder.  Our premises have been recently renovated and the practice is the largest in Dublin city centre.

                  We are active advocates for positive change in our health services
